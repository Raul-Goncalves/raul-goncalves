## **_My History🚀_**
#### My name is Raul, I started programming at the age of 15, I was always interested in new technologies, so whenever there was something problematic related to the technology I tried to fix it myself, most of the time I tried to fix it, and always in the end it ends up being spoiled by me. But I started making a plugin for a certain game called Minecraft and from that moment I never left programming like the game.
