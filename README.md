# **_My HistoryðŸš€_**
Programming has been my passion and vocation since I was 15. Now, at 20, I have a solid background in software development, having completed a technical course at the School of Computer Programming. During this time, I've learned various languages and technologies, each contributing uniquely to my personal growth.

My first major interest was in Java, a powerful and versatile language that provided me with a solid foundation in object-oriented programming concepts. While my focus has shifted over time, I still appreciate Java's robustness and efficiency, keeping it as a valuable tool in my skill set.

In recent years, my attention has turned to Flutter, a framework that captivated me with its ability to create beautiful and efficient native applications for multiple platforms from a single codebase. The ease of use, combined with Flutter's performance and flexibility, has made me fall in love with this technology, allowing me to explore and innovate in mobile app development.

I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. My journey as a programmer is marked by curiosity and a continuous desire to learn. I am excited to collaborate on innovative projects and contribute to dynamic teams, where I can apply my expertise in Flutter and other technologies.
