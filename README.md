## **_My History🚀_**
#### My name is Raul, I ate programming for 15 years, whenever there was a lot of curiosity about technology, so whenever there was something problematic I tried to fix it myself, but it always worked, so I was always interested in how the system or the programming of the device works . I play a game until today that taught me a program that was Minecraft. I was always very addicted to this game so I went to a server and saw a lot of things that I didn't have in the normal game, so I was looking for how to do that and from that point on I never abandoned programming and I am always looking to learn each programming language
